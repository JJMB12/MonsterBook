        description: "Tending to stand on one leg, this monster somewhat resembles an umbrella. The Aknosom is highly territorial; it will spread out its wings and show off its characteristic comb to scare off threats. It also bears flammable venom that burns fiercely and lingers on the ground when lit. Draw the beast to water for an easier fight."),

        image: "MHRise-Almudron_Icon",
        color: [Color.mint, Color.black],
        description: "As its name implies, Almudron spends a great deal of time lurking in mud - at least until it emerges to smother approaching prey. From its tail oozes a strange golden fluid, which Almudron uses to dissolve the ground beneath its prey, arresting them in a mire so that it can drag them under. When enraged, it produces more fluid, turning the mud golden. When you see gold, watch out!"),

        headline: "アンジャナフ (Anjanafu))",
        image: "MHRise-Anjanath_Icon",
        color: [Color.mint, Color.black],
        description: "This belligerent monster will attack anything without hesitation. The membrane along its tail fans out when it is provoked-a behavior theorized to be either an act of intimidation or thermoregulation, as it has been known to do so when it breathes fire."),
